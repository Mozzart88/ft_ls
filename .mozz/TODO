Makefile:
	☐ Usual rules
	☐ Recompile the program if necessary
Libft:
	☐ At the root of repo
Norm:
	☐ As usual
Errors:
	☐ Handle errors sensitivly
	☐ If you ensure, handle errors like ls
Leaks:
	☐ As usual
Author file:
	☐ As usual
Allowed functions:
	☐ write
	☐ opendir
	☐ readdir
	☐ closedir
	☐ stat
	☐ lstat
	☐ getpwuid
	☐ getgrgid
	☐ listxattr
	☐ time
	☐ ctime
	☐ readlink

	☐ perror
	☐ strerror
	☐ exit
	☐ Allowed other functions to carry out the bonus part as long as their use is justified during your defence.
Mandatory part:
	☐ Recode system command ls
	☐ Behavior must be identical to original ls command with the following variations:
		☐ Optins to recode:
			☐ -l (If not argument, than you do not have deal with the multiple column format for exit)
			☐ -R (RECOMENDED to implement from the very beginning)
			☐ -a
			☐ -r
			☐ -t
		☐ ACL and extended attributs not required
		☐ Output must stay as udentical as pasible to system command
	☐ man ls
Bonus part:
	☐ Manage ACL and extended attributs
	☐ Manage column without option -l (man 4 tty)
	☐ Manage options:
		☐ -u
		☐ -f
		☐ -g
		☐ -d
	☐ Manage of views in colors (option -G)
	☐ Optimization of code (i.ex. time of response on BIG ls -lR)
Submission:
	☐ As usual
Recomended helpers:
	☐ ft_list_dir (opendir, closedir, readdir)
	☐ ft_inspect_file (stat)
